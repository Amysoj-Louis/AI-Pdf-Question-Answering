**3. Answer Generation:**

**(i) As Rajat’s supervisor can you find out whether the poor performance is due to poor training or to some other cause?**

**Answer 1:** The supervisor should investigate both potential causes - inadequate training and other factors. A conversation with Rajat is crucial. The supervisor should inquire about his training experience, identify any gaps, and ask about any challenges he might be facing. This conversation should be conducted in a supportive and non-judgmental manner.

**(ii) If you find Rajat has been inadequately trained, how do you go about introducing a remedial training programme?**

**Answer 1:** The supervisor should:

* **Identify the specific training gaps:**  This involves analyzing Rajat's work, his feedback, and potentially reviewing the initial training program.

* **Observational feedback:** The supervisor should observe Rajat's work, identifying areas where he could improve, without directly interfering with his process.
* **Regular check-ins:**  Scheduled, brief check-ins with Rajat can allow the supervisor to monitor his progress, offer feedback, and address any concerns.
* **Positive reinforcement:**  Focusing on Rajat's strengths and providing praise for his efforts can motivate him and create a supportive environment.

**(v) Should you discuss the situation with Rajat?**

**Answer 1:**  Yes, it is essential to discuss the situation with Rajat. This discussion should be:

* **Private and respectful:**  The conversation should take place in a private setting, free from distractions, and should be conducted with empathy and understanding. 
* **Focus on improvement:**  The focus should be on helping Rajat improve his performance, not on criticizing him.
* **Two-way communication:**  The supervisor should listen to Rajat's perspective, address his concerns, and work collaboratively to find solutions.
